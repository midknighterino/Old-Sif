# VisMod
A Visual Moderation Bot for Discord

Currently WIP, though functional. Offers a warn, mute, kick and ban command with images for each, an embed in the same channel the command is used, and logging to a predefined loggin channel. 

Note: the bot token and userids have been stripped from the configs file and need to be edited in to work, if you do pull the files

Note #2: node_modules could not be uploaded.
