# VisMod
*A Visual Moderation Bot for Discord*

Currently WIP, though functional. Offers a warn, mute, kick and ban command with images for each, an embed in the same channel the command is used, and logging to a predefined logging channel. 

The goal of the project is to make a moderation bot where most commands have an embedded text and image response, creatiing a more visual experience for discord moderators and server members. Secondly, we'll be bringing in some novel features to make moderating a discord server easier. 

**Project staff:**
- Midknight - I'm more an advisor, suggesting ideas for new functions and doing some editing of the text and visuals
- Clam - Is the actual coder, doing all the heavy, thankless lifting.

**Novel features:**
- +mutevc - mutes all non-mod users in a VC, useful for moderation, events and debating

**Notes:**
- the bot token and userids have been stripped from the configs file. 
- node_modules could not be uploaded, but is required for bot to function.
