# VisMod
*A Visual Moderation Bot for Discord*

Currently WIP, though functional. Offers a warn, mute, kick and ban command with images for each, an embed in the same channel the command is used, and logging to a predefined logging channel. 

**Goals:**
- Most commands should have an embed output with options for text and image responses when the command is succesful  
- Novel commands that improve moderation of medium to large sized servers, like a command to mute an entire voice channel

**Project staff:**
- Midknight - I'm more an advisor, suggesting ideas for new functions and doing some editing of the text and visuals
- Clam - Is the actual coder, doing all the heavy, thankless lifting.

**Novel features:**
- +mutevc - mutes all non-mod users in a VC, useful for moderation, events and debating

**Notes:**
- the bot token and userids have been stripped from the configs file. 
- node_modules could not be uploaded, but is required for bot to function.
