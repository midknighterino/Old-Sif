*Building a better all-in-one bot*

Currently WIP, though functional. Offers a warn, mute, kick and ban command with images for each, an embed in the same channel the command is used, and logging to a predefined logging channel. 

**Goals:**
- Most commands should have an embed output with options for text and image responses when the command is succesful  
- Novel commands that improve moderation of medium to large sized servers, like a command to mute an entire voice channel

**Novel features:**
- VC Mute
- VC Roles
- Auto Slowmode

**Project staff:**
- Midknight - I'm more an advisor, suggesting ideas for new functions and doing some editing of the text and visuals
- Clam - Is the actual coder, doing all the heavy, thankless lifting.

**Notes:**
- the bot token and userids have been stripped from the configs file. 
- node_modules could not be uploaded, but is required for bot to function.

**Why we chose open source**
- It is our belief that all knowledge should be shared. In that spirit, we've decided to allow for modifications. If you have a cool idea, run it past Midknight or Clam in the discord server (https://discord.gg/Mc8wsn). We'll definitely take the idea onboard :)
